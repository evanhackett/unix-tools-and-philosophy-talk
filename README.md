# Intro to Unix Philosophy and Tools

Code from the tech talk at PDX Code Guild given on 1/21/21.


The rot cipher has 3 iterations:

1. prompting user for interactive input
2. taking in input as command line arguments
3. taking in input from stdin

Each iteration makes the program more "unixy" by making it easier to use as part of a pipeline.
